Painting: Johann KÃ¶ler - Hercules Removes Cerberus from the Gates of Hell, 1855

Hyginus Chapter 30, Section 13: canem Cerberum Typhonis filium ab inferis regi in conspectum adduxit

**Commentary -** 
1. Hyginus writes that hercules brings Cerberus *ab inferis* translating to away from/from the underworld. 
We clearly see this in the painting from the red glow of distant flames. From this we know Hercules must be accending from the underworld.
As well, we see another similarity as Hyginus uses the verb *adduxit* meaning to lead. This matches up in the painting as Hercules forcefully leads Cerberus from the underworld.

2. One difference is that Hyginus doesn't descrie Cerberus at all. In the painting, we see Cerberus is three headed dog but Hyginus chose to not describe Cerberus
even though he does take the time to describe many other things like the Lernaean Hydra. 
Though this could be for many reasons, t is possible Hyginus wanted to keep the work as simple as possible and he belived his audience was already familar with Cerberus so he didn't requrire a description.
