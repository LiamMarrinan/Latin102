**Needs minor revisions**
**Excellent draft!**


Your first sentence should use a negative purpose clause to say that when Deianira, the daughter of Oeneus and the wife of Hercules saw that the beautiful young girl Iole had been brought (to her house), she began to devise a plot in order not to lose her husband (or “be deprived of” her husband).

>Cum Deianira, filia Oenei et uxor Herculis, videret Iolen adductam esse, Deinaea conjurationem copiebat machinari, conjugem ne privaret.

Your second sentence should express that she sent her servant to bring to Hercules a garment dipped in the blood of the centaur Nessus, which she thought was a love potion.

>Ea famulum misit ad dandum vestem, 
sanguine centauri Nessi imbuitur, herculi, ❌ **What is the constrution of *sanguinem* here? 

**Correction  sanguinem is in the accusitive case as they are what the arrows were dipped into**   ❌ **Accusative case won't work to express that idea.**


quem ea philtrum cogitavit. 

**Correction quem ea philtrum ratus est**


Your third sentence should say that Hercules put the garment on and it immediately burst into flames.

>Cum Hercules indueret vestem, ea inflammata fecit.

**Correction Cum Hercules indueret vestem, ea inflammavit**


Your fourth sentence should express that Hercules threw the slave, whom Deianira had sent to bring the garment back, into the sea.

>Hercules servem❌, quem Deianira misit ut vestem recollegerit, in mare misit.

**Correction Hercules servum, quem Deianira misit ut vestem recollegerit, in mare misit.**❌ **You're in past-time narrative (secondary sequence).  What tenses of the subjunctive are possible for your dependent clauses?**

Your last sentence should express that it is reported (or said) that Hercules rose to immortality, but Deianira killed herself on account of this deed.

>Hercule interfecto, Id dicti❌  sunt, Herculem ad immortalitatem Ascendisse, sed Deianira interfecit ipsam propter rem.

**Correction Hercule interfecto, dicitur, Herculem ad immortalitatem Ascendisse, sed Deianira interfecit ipsam propter rem. ❌ **Great idea to modify Hercules with a participle!  But since he's already in the sentence, don't try to introduce him again in an ablative absolute:  just modify his name diretly.**
