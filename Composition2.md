Your first sentence should use a negative purpose clause to say that when Deianira, the daughter of Oeneus and the wife of Hercules saw that the beautiful young girl Iole had been brought (to her house), she began to devise a plot in order not to lose her husband (or “be deprived of” her husband).

>Cum Deianira, filia Oenei et uxor Herculis, videret Iolen adductam esse, Deinaea conjurationem copiebat machinari, conjugem ne privaret.

Your second sentence should express that she sent her servant to bring to Hercules a garment dipped in the blood of the centaur Nessus, which she thought was a love potion.

>Ea falulum misit ut daret vestem, sanguinem centarui Nessi imbuitur, herculi, quem ea philtrum cogitavit. 

Your third sentence should say that Hercules put the garment on and it immediately burst into flames.

>Cum Hercules indueret vestem, ea inflammata fecit.

Your fourth sentence should express that Hercules threw the slave, whom Deianira had sent to bring the garment back, into the sea.

>Hercules servem, quem Deianira misit ut vestem recollegerit, in mare misit.

Your last sentence should express that it is reported (or said) that Hercules rose to immortality, but Deianira killed herself on account of this deed.

>Id dicti sunt, Herculem ad immortalitatem Ascendisse, sed Deianira interfecit ipsam propter rem.
