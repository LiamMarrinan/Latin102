**C. Literary commentary**

1. Stating that the horses of Diomedes *carne humana vescebantur* really highlights how terrifying they are. The idea that they fed on and even enjoyed human flesh shows the extent of their terror. As well, the use of the comparitive with *maiorem* helps complete the ideas presented as it shows how even though both Hercules and Jupiter helped it was Jupiter who did the majority of the cleaning.
