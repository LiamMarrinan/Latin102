Deianira, uxor Herculis, flumen magnum, cui nomen Evenus erat, non poterat transire, et centaurum Nessum, qui filius Ixionis et Nubis erat, auxilium rogavit. 

Hic Deianiram sublatam in flumine ipso uiolare uoluit. 

huc Hercules cum interuenisset et Deianira cum fidem eius implorasset, Nessum sagittis confixit.

ille moriens, cum sciret sagittas Hydrae Lernaeae felle tinctas magnam vim habere, sanguinem suum exceptum Deianirae dedit et id philtrum esse dixit.

B. Grammatical questions

1.Identify the antecedent of cui, and its gender and number. Then explain what case cui is, and how it functions in the relative clause. (I.e., why is cui in this case?)

>the antecedent is flumen. cui is in the dative singular neuter. It is in this case because it is the indirect object❌ of the sentence. **Go over exactly why dative is used**

2.Identify the form of transire. Explain why you placed it in the clause you chose.

>transire is in the present active infinitive and because of that is in a dependent clause.❌

3.sublatam is from a verb that is a compound of sub plus a verb you should know very well. Identify the form of this participle (which for participles means: gender, case, number, tense voice). Find the dictionary entry for this word in thed Lewis-Short’s Latin Dictionary, and give its URN here.

>This is the perfect passive participle feminine accusitive singular. urn:cite2:hmt:ls.markdown:n17964

4.Identify the form of sagittis. Why does Hyginus use this case?

>It is in the ablative plural and uses the ablative of instrument.

5.Identify the form of moriens.

>present active participle nomanitive singular. 

6.Identify felle. Why does Hyginus use this case?

>it is in the ablative case and it is the ablative of insturment

7.Identify the form of tinctas.

>perfect passive participle accusitive present ❌

8.Identify the form of exceptum.

>perfect passive participle accusitive singular masculine

9.William Faulkner’s novel As I lay dying takes its title from an English translation of a single word in Odyssey 11.424. In Greek, where participles function very differently from English but similarly to Latin, that word is a present active participle. Suggest one or more possible translations of Faulkner’s title into Latin.

>moriens

C. Translate

Deianira, the wife of Hercules, unable to cross the large river, which was named Evanus, asked the centaur Nessus, who was the son of Ixion and Nubes, for help.
this centaur, with Deianira having been submerged by himself, wanted to violate her.
Hither⁉️🤔, when Hercules intervened and when Deianira begged for her own protection, he pierced Nussus with arrows.
As he died, knowing the arrows were soaked with a powerful poison of the Hydra Lernaean, having taken out the blood🤔, he gave it to Deianira and said it was a love charm.
